# ðŸ“Š Metrics

Malacca use [Cloudflare Analytics Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/) to manage metrics like token usage, errors, latency, cache hit rate and so on.

You can query the analytics engine with [SQL API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/) to get the metrics to draw your own dashboard.

```SQL
SELECT
     blob1 AS endpoint, 
     blob2 as path, 
     blob3 as status, 
     double1 as latency, 
     double2 as prompt_tokens, 
     double3 as completion_tokens 
FROM MALACCA 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30' MINUTE
```
