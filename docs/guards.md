# üõ°Ô∏è Guard

Malacca's guard is designed to protect your API from inappropriate content. It is a powerful tool that can be used to protect your API from a variety of attacks, including but not limited to:

- **Content Filtering**: The guard can be used to filter out content that is inappropriate or offensive.
- **Abuse Detection**: The guard can be used to detect and prevent abuse of your API by bad actors.

You can customize the guards logic by modifying the guards middleware in `src/middlewares/guards.ts`.
