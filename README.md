# Malacca

![Malacca Logo](./docs/malacca.jpg)

**Malacca** is an open-source AI gateway designed to become the central hub in the world of AI.

It is fully **CloudFlare Native**: allowing for global scale deployment without any maintenance overhead and free for 1M requests each day.

It is written in **TypeScript**: ensuring adaptability to the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem and catering to the diverse needs of application developers.

> Malacca is still an early-stage project, containing many experiments by the author. Currently, it only supports AzureOpenAI. While Malacca provides numerous features, its primary purpose is to offer a framework and examples to help users better implement their own custom functionalities. In fact, we encourage you to read the code and adapt it to your specific needs. We welcome contributions and ideas from the community to help expand and improve this project.

## Features

- üåç **Global Scale, Zero Maintenance**
  - Built on Cloudflare Workers, Malacca offers seamless global deployment without the need to manage servers.
  
- üß© **High Flexibility and Extensibility**
  - Written in TypeScript, which provides excellent readability and allows easy customization and expansion of features.
  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Comprehensive Feature Set**
  - üîë **Virtual Key**: Manage access permissions using virtual keys, providing more granular control over API access.
  - ‚ö° **Caching**: Reduce latency and costs by caching repeat requests.
  - üõ°Ô∏è **Guard**: Deny the request if the request or response has inappropriate content.
  - üìä **Analytics**: Track the status, error, latency and usage of tokens, allowing you to understand and manage API costs.
  - üìã **Logging**: Record requests and responses to further fine-tune or reinforcement learning.
  - üö¶ **Rate Limiting**: Protect upstream API resources by controlling request rates.
  - üîÑ **Fallback**: Fallback to CF Workers AI if the upstream API fails.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A **Cloudflare** account.
- **Wrangler CLI** installed (used to manage Cloudflare Workers).
- Enable Workers Analytics Engine. (Head to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/analytics-engine)).

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oilbeater/malacca.git
   cd malacca
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the Project**

   Create KV Namespace for LLM Cache and Virtual Key
   
   ```bash
   npx wrangler kv namespace create MALACCA_CACHE
   npx wrangler kv namespace create MALACCA_USER
   ```

   Then edit the `wrangler.toml` configuration with the KV ids generated.

4. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers**

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   Then you can visit Malacca with the Worker domain or custom domain.

### Supported LLM Providers

- [OpenAI](./docs/openai.md)
- [Azure OpenAI](./docs/azure_openai.md)
- [DeepSeek](./docs/deepseek.md)

## Customization and Extension

Malacca offers a flexible architecture, allowing users to:

- Add custom middleware to suit specific needs.
- Extend or modify existing features.
- Integrate additional upstream AI API services.

You can just clone and modify the code then `wrangler deploy` to deploy your code globally.
